## Overview
### Description
**Carpany** is an iOS Application for all car sellers, car owners and car fans. In Carpany, people can stay up-to-date with the latest car news, filter the posts they are interested in and read the full text, and search for information about specific cars and car-related products, including: release dates, latest prices and discounts, word of mouth and reviews, etc. In addition, car fans with the same interests can create their own circles of different themes and chat, share posts and post messages in them. Users can also add friends to each other, share and chat. Various posts within the software can also be shared on different social media platforms. Car manufacturers and retailers of related products can also register in the application and post information and posts about their products. In addition, the application also integrates with the map function, which allows people to find parking lots, related stores, gas stations, as well as mark the related car retailers and product discount stores according to the cars owned by different users, etc.

- **Scope:** First we plan to create basic functions such as import information of different cars in our database, creating posts, sharing information and provide information on maps. As a result, we might intergrate apis of some applications such as `cars.com`, `Google Map` and `Twitter`. Later, we might update more interesting functions like car modification simulation, car pricing evaluation and so on. The App has large potential for better use when working with the help of social networking apps and recommondation algorithms in the future.
